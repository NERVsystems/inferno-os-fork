# GitHub Actions is Blocked

**Date:** January 7, 2026

## Definitive Finding

**Even the simplest possible workflow fails:**

```yaml
- name: Echo test
  run: echo "Hello"
```

**Result:** Fails in 4 seconds with 0 steps executed.

## What This Proves

**GitHub Actions cannot run ANY workflow on this repository.**

This is a **repository/organization-level block**, not a code issue.

## Verified Facts

1. ✅ Workflows were working (commit 3c70673)
2. ✅ Code is correct (verified locally)
3. ✅ X11 removal is correct
4. ✅ YAML files valid
5. ✅ Simple "echo" workflow fails
6. ✅ macOS and Ubuntu both fail
7. ✅ All workflows fail identically (4s, 0 steps)

## Cannot Be Fixed From Code

I cannot fix this because:
- No steps execute (can't debug)
- Happens before checkout (code doesn't matter)
- Affects all workflows equally
- API returns permission errors

## What User Needs to Check

### 1. Repository Settings
Navigate to: https://github.com/NERVsystems/infernode/settings/actions

Check:
- [ ] Actions permissions: "Allow all actions and reusable workflows"
- [ ] Workflow permissions: Read and write
- [ ] Actions are enabled (not disabled)

### 2. Organization Settings
Navigate to: https://github.com/organizations/NERVsystems/settings/actions

Check:
- [ ] Actions are enabled for private repositories
- [ ] infernode repository is not blocked
- [ ] Quota/billing status

### 3. Billing
Navigate to: https://github.com/organizations/NERVsystems/settings/billing

Check:
- [ ] GitHub Actions minutes available
- [ ] No payment issues
- [ ] Private repo Actions quota

### 4. Security Alerts
Check if:
- [ ] Repository flagged for security review
- [ ] Actions suspended due to detected issues
- [ ] Any notifications about the repository

## Timeline

**Last successful run:**
- Commit: 3c70673
- Time: 2026-01-06 16:07 UTC
- Result: ✅ SUCCESS

**First failure:**
- Commit: b1d9130
- Time: 2026-01-06 16:26 UTC
- Result: ❌ FAILURE (0 steps)

**Gap:** 19 minutes

**Since then:** All workflows fail identically

## Probable Cause

**Private repository Actions quota exceeded.**

Evidence:
- macOS runners expensive for private repos
- Many workflow runs in short time
- Timing coincidental with X11 removal
- Affects all workflows equally

## Solution

**User must:**
1. Check GitHub Actions billing/quota
2. Enable Actions if disabled
3. Or wait for quota reset
4. Or upgrade plan

**I cannot do this - requires repository owner permissions.**

## Impact

**NONE on the ARM64 Inferno port.**

- Code works ✓
- System functional ✓
- Documentation complete ✓
- CI was proven to work ✓

This is a post-completion billing/quota issue.

**Bottom Line:** GitHub Actions is blocked at platform/org level. Not fixable from code. Requires repository owner action.
