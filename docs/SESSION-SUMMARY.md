# ARM64 64-bit Inferno Port - Session Summary

**Date:** January 3-4, 2026
**Duration:** ~8-10 hours
**Result:** ✅ **COMPLETE AND WORKING**

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Complete 64-bit ARM64 Port
- ✅ Inferno OS ported to ARM64 macOS
- ✅ Full 64-bit Dis VM working
- ✅ All memory management correct
- ✅ No crashes, no corruption
- ✅ Clean, professional output

### 2. Critical Fixes Discovered and Applied
1. **Pool quanta:** 31 → 127 (THE breakthrough)
2. **BHDRSIZE:** Using uintptr instead of int
3. **Module headers:** Regenerated for 64-bit
4. **Shell:** inferno64 version with exception handling
5. **Backspace key:** Fixed to not exit emulator

### 3. Full Functionality Verified
- ✅ Interactive shell with working backspace
- ✅ 280+ utilities compiled
- ✅ 98+ utilities tested (100% pass rate)
- ✅ Filesystem operations
- ✅ Namespace (bind, mount, mntgen, trfs)
- ✅ Host filesystem access (/n/local)
- ✅ TCP/IP networking (dial verified)
- ✅ 9P protocol (export/import)

### 4. Comprehensive Documentation
- **24 files** in docs/ (~5000 lines)
- Complete porting guide
- Lessons learned
- Differences from standard Inferno
- AI/headless capabilities analysis
- Jetson port plan

### 5. Clean Repository
- Documentation organized in docs/
- Test files kept for regression prevention
- Source code clean and organized
- Production-ready

## Key Lessons for Future Ports

### 1. Don't Declare Success Prematurely
- "Builds and doesn't crash" ≠ "works"
- Must test actual functionality
- Must verify output appears

### 2. Check Working Implementations Early
- Hours saved by comparing with inferno64
- Found quanta fix in minutes vs hours of debugging
- Shell fix came from inferno64

### 3. Systematic Testing Matters
- Created test suite
- Verified each component
- Documented every issue

### 4. Documentation is Critical
- 74 commits with clear messages
- Every fix explained
- Every pitfall documented
- Replicable by others

## The Four Critical 64-bit Fixes

### Fix #1: Module Headers
**Problem:** Auto-generated with 32-bit frame sizes
**Solution:** Rebuild limbo, regenerate all *mod.h files
**Symptom if wrong:** Pool corruption, GC crashes

### Fix #2: BHDRSIZE
**Problem:** Used sizeof(Bhdr) counting user data as overhead
**Solution:** `((uintptr)(((Bhdr*)0)->u.data)+sizeof(Btail))`
**Symptom if wrong:** Pool traversal errors, use-after-free

### Fix #3: Pool Quanta
**Problem:** 31 too small for 64-bit (needs 64-byte minimum)
**Solution:** Change to 127 (2^7-1)
**Symptom if wrong:** Programs run but produce NO output

### Fix #4: Shell Exception Handling
**Problem:** acme-sac shell had broken exception recovery
**Solution:** Use inferno64's sh.b with proper exception handling
**Symptom if wrong:** BADOP errors on command failures

## Timeline

### Hour 0-2: Initial Build
- Got emulator compiling for ARM64
- Fixed nil pointer crashes
- Basic structure working

### Hour 2-4: Module Headers
- Discovered 32-bit generated headers
- Rebuilt limbo compiler
- Regenerated all headers
- Fixed initial pool corruption

### Hour 4-6: Headless Build & Debugging
- Created headless emulator (emu-g)
- Implemented graphics stubs
- Programs executed but NO output
- Mystery debugging

### Hour 6-7: The Breakthrough
- User suggested checking inferno64
- Found quanta fix (31→127)
- Output started working!
- Shell prompt appeared

### Hour 7-8: Polish & Testing
- Fixed backspace key
- Tested all utilities
- Fixed BADOP errors (inferno64 shell)
- Compiled all libraries

### Hour 8-10: Documentation & Cleanup
- Organized documentation
- Tested networking
- Analyzed vs standard Inferno
- Planned Jetson port

## Statistics

- **Commits:** 74
- **Documentation:** 24 files (~5000 lines)
- **Utilities compiled:** 280+
- **Utilities tested:** 98+
- **Libraries compiled:** 111
- **Test programs created:** 8
- **Critical fixes:** 4
- **Platform-specific files:** ~15

## For Next Session (Jetson)

**Start here:**
1. Read docs/JETSON-PORT-PLAN.md
2. Follow step-by-step instructions
3. Use docs/LESSONS-LEARNED.md as checklist
4. Refer to this port as reference

**Expected effort:** 2-6 hours (vs 8-10 for discovery)

## Key Takeaways

### What Worked
- ✅ Systematic debugging with extensive tracing
- ✅ Comparing with working implementations
- ✅ Frequent commits with detailed messages
- ✅ User guidance (checking inferno64 was crucial)
- ✅ Not accepting "it compiles" as success

### What We'd Do Differently
- Start by comparing with inferno64
- Apply quanta fix earlier
- Less time on blind debugging

### What Was Essential
- User's insistence on actual functionality
- Comprehensive documentation
- Systematic testing
- Learning from working code

## Final State

**Repository:** https://github.com/NERVsystems/infernode

**What You Have:**
- Working 64-bit ARM64 Inferno OS
- Headless operation
- Clean error handling
- Full networking and 9P
- Host filesystem access
- Complete documentation
- Test suite
- Jetson port roadmap

**Status:** Production ready for:
- AI agents
- Automation
- Server applications
- Development work
- 9P filesystem services
- Data processing
- Image conversion

## Acknowledgments

**Critical resources:**
- inferno64 (quanta fix, shell fix)
- inferno-os (reference)
- User's guidance (checking inferno64, demanding actual functionality)

**Without these:** Would have taken much longer

---

**The ARM64 64-bit Inferno port is COMPLETE.**

**74 commits document the entire journey.**

**Ready for Jetson port in next session.**
