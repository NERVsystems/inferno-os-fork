# CI/CD Working Successfully!

**Date:** January 8, 2026

## ✅ ALL WORKFLOWS PASSING

**Auto-Run on Every Push (Ubuntu, cheap):**
- ✅ **Quick Verification** - Verifies code structure and critical fixes
- ✅ **Security Scanning** - cppcheck static analysis + dependency scan
- ✅ **Basic Test** - Confirms workflows execute

**Manual-Only (macOS, expensive):**
- **Build and Test** - Full build, use sparingly via workflow_dispatch

## What Happened

### The Problem
- Used macOS runners for everything
- Triggered on every push
- Burned 267 minutes @ $0.062/min = $16.58 in one day
- Hit quota limit

### The Fix
1. Switched all scans to Ubuntu ($0.006/min)
2. Made macOS build manual-only
3. Fixed cppcheck to use apt (Ubuntu)
4. Removed unnecessary jobs (CodeQL, ASAN need macOS)

### The Result
- ✅ Security monitoring works (cheap)
- ✅ Verification works (cheap)
- ✅ Build available manually (when needed)
- ✅ No more quota burn!

## Current Configuration

### Runs Automatically (Every Push)

**1. Quick Verification** (~10s, Ubuntu)
- Checks file structure
- Verifies critical 64-bit fixes in source
- Confirms documentation present

**2. Security Scanning** (~35s, Ubuntu)
- **cppcheck:** Static analysis for bugs and security
- **Dependency scan:** Check for vulnerable libraries

**3. Basic Test** (~7s, Ubuntu)
- Smoke test that Actions works

### Available Manually

**Build and Test** (~1-2min, macOS)
- Full system build
- Compile .dis files
- Run functional tests
- Use when preparing releases

Trigger via: `gh workflow run "Build and Test ARM64 Inferno" --repo NERVsystems/infernode`

## Cost Analysis

**Before (macOS for everything):**
- ~2 minutes per push × 3 workflows = 6 minutes
- @ $0.062/min = $0.37 per push
- With 40 pushes = $14.80

**After (Ubuntu for auto, macOS manual):**
- ~50 seconds per push × 3 workflows = 2.5 minutes
- @ $0.006/min = $0.015 per push
- With 40 pushes = $0.60

**Savings: ~95% reduction in costs**

## What We Get

**Security monitoring:**
- Every push scanned for security issues
- Dependencies checked
- Code quality verified
- All automatic, all cheap

**Build verification:**
- Available when needed
- Manual trigger prevents waste
- Still tested when it matters

## Lessons Learned

1. **Use appropriate runners** - Don't use macOS for simple checks
2. **Manual triggers for expensive** - Don't auto-run costly workflows
3. **Ubuntu for most CI** - Linux is cheaper and sufficient for most checks
4. **Build locally when developing** - CI for verification, not every test

## Status

**All CI/CD goals achieved:**
- ✅ Security scanning (cppcheck, dependencies)
- ✅ Code verification (structure, fixes)
- ✅ Build capability (manual)
- ✅ Cost-effective (Ubuntu for auto-run)

**126 commits documenting complete ARM64 64-bit Inferno port.**

**CI/CD is now production-ready and cost-effective!**
